# Regression Model Selection Using a Genetic Algorithm
## By Matthew Keeran
Runs via python GA.py

### Input:
Prompts user for a csv file. Then allows users to set the values of the parameters for the genetic algorithm.

### Output:
Displays the best model found, the best value of the statisical criteria it optimized for, and the corresponding transformation of its variables. Then it reports runtime statistics based on the various steps of the algorithm.
